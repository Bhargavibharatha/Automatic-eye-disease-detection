# Automatic-eye-disease-detection
In this paper author is describing concept to detect eyes pediatric age genetic diseases using Pupillometry device data as this device is very accurate and itâ€™s not require huge number of clinical test to detect disease.
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model developed in Python for the automatic prediction of eye diseases using medical images. The model is trained on a diverse dataset and utilizes deep learning techniques for accurate and efficient disease classification.

Features
Image Classification: The model classifies eye images into various disease categories, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Deep Learning: Built on a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract complex features from input images, enabling accurate predictions.

Open Source: The project is open source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community.

Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/srilekha-netha/eye-disease-prediction.git
##Dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application python DiseaseDetection.py

Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000 and upload your eye images for predictions.
